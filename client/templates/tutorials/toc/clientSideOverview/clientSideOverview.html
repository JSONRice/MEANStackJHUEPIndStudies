    <p>This tutorial series covers the client side processes of a MEAN stack web application. The client side is completely different than the server side of the web application. The client contains the AngularJS framework modules that compose the MVC (Model-View-Controller design pattern) modules, templates (HTML views), directives (DOM manipulators), and vendor dependencies.</p>

Stylsheets add life to each of the HTML markup components. This web application applies the Twitter Bootstrap CSS (cascading stylesheets) and has custom CSS and LESS (Lean Style Sheets) for dynamic component styling. LESS allows for style inheritance and you will find within the less directory a color scheme that conforms to the mockup designs.">stylesheets</a>

The templates are a collection of HTML (hyper text markup language) web pages. Many times a template is a piece of HTML and doesn't necessarily need to start with the <html> or <body> tags but usually starts with a <div> tag. Each tutorial in this series is a template. What you see on the web page can be many templates working in unison.">templates</a>

The initial setup is tedious but additional updates are trivial. A system administrator or software librarian from the CM or QA team will typically manage these but in a dynamic Agile team, the developers can add or remove the vendor libraries at will. This allows the web application to run in production and load all vendor libraries without having to go out to the web and load them. This speeds up the dependency injection.">vendor</a>
