  <h4>Welcome to the Angular UI showcase.</h4>
  <p>This showcase features some nice UI components that you can start using now within your Angular 1.x web apps. Please expand the Angular UI branch within the Table of Contents over on the left side of the screen to see some specific UI examples that are based on Angular UI, Bootstrap, and custom components released under the MIT license through Github. All sources are cited for your convenience. This showcase is not an extensive tutorial of Angular UI or Bootstrap but rather introduces web developers to some components that they can apply today within their web apps. Happy coding.</p>
