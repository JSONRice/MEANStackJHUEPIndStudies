    <p>AngularJS (commonly referred to as Angular or Angular.js) is an open-source web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–view-model (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in Rich Internet Applications (e.g. AJAX). ~ Wikipedia</p>
