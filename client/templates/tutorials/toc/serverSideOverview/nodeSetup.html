    <p>NodeJS setup really depends on what your project setup entails, but there are a few base standards that go along with node. </p> 
    <p>To start using NodeJS download it from their web site (Google search: 'Node download') then once installed you will have NPM (Node Package Manager).</p>
    <p>Head over to the root level of the web application in the terminal and run the following to download the dependencies:</p>
    <pre>npm install</pre>
    <p>The dependencies are all stored within the package.json at the root level of the web application.</p>
    <p>Checkout the package.json for a list of production and developer level dependencies.</p>
