    <p>ExpressJS is a lightweight framework similar to other lightweight web frameworks such as Sinatra for Ruby. ExpressJS provides mechanisms for dependency injection by allowing developers to allocate singleton dependencies. See the main app.js file to get a feel for how ExpressJS dependencies are injected with ElectrolyteJS. Most of the ExpressJS singleton dependencies are created via the utils within the server/utils directory.</p> 
    <p>To start using ExpressJS download it from npm with:</p>
    <pre>npm install express --save</pre>
    <p>Then add the following to your NodeJS master file to start using express:</p>
    <pre>var express = require('express');</pre>
    <p>Check out the app.js file at the root level of the web app to get a sense for how ExpressJS is being utilized.</p>
