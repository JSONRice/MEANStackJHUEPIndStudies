NodeJS (NPM) Installation:
Google search "NodeJS Windows" The first hit should be a link to nodejs.org Navigate to that link and download NodeJS. NodeJS contains npm.

Now use Git (install first) to clone the tutorial:

git clone https://github.com/jasonwr/MEANStackJHUEPIndStudies.git

Navigate to the newly cloned project:

cd MEANStackJHUEPIndStudies

Now since NodeJS is installed download the dependencies contained in package.json

npm install

Note:
If you see any deprecated modules feel free to adjust the package.json and submit a fork request to the Github repository.0fc.


Mongo Installation:
Download Mongo from www.mongodb.com
If your on a Mac ppen a terminal and add the path of your Mongo directory with the bin to the /etc/paths file (use vi or emacs to edit this file, must be sudo). Then restart your terminal session and type:

echo $PATH

The path should be of the format <path-to-mongo>/bin Where "<path-to-mongo>" is the location of your mongo download and the bin directory should be under there.
If you're using Linux simply append the Mongo bin to your PATH variable in your .bashrc or .bash_profile file.

Now create the db directory under your home directory:

mkdir -p ~/data/db

Then start up the mongo daemon:

mongod --dbpath ~/data/db

Open up a new terminal tab and type the following for database access:

mongo

Troubleshooting Mongo:
Do not create the db directory under root (/data/db) rather for security and simplicity run under your home directory. If you create under /data/db this requires root (sudo) to run. If you attempt to connect and get a timed out connection examine the mongod output. Chances are you attempted connection before the daemon was finished setting up the socket.
