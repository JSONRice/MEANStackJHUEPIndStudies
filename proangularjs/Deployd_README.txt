For those readers who prefer an alternative to Deployd , Adam has prepared
alternative chapters that use the hosted Parse.com service. These chapters
include the SportsStore application and the AngularJS Ajax and RESTful web
service features and every feature from the original chapters is covered.

** Readers Note (Sep. 1, 2015): Rather than use Deployd or Parse.com just use Mongo NoSQL with ExpressJS.
