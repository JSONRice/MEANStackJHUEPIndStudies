Unix Notes:

If on Linux make sure to update your packages and add dev tools:

sudo yum -y update
sudo yum -y "Development Tools"

Kerberos is required and needs g++ and Python:

sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ python

Then install the Kerberos libraries:

# or Debian is: sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev libkrb5-server
sudo yum install krb5-devel krb5-server

The following involves installing global node modules. Currently Mac OS X requires
'sudo' when running the native terminal. The following is a work around to 'sudo'
Running 'sudo' on Mac OS X is difficult and brings a myriad of troubles.

Note: first install homebrew (brew command) with the following:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Then see: https://gist.github.com/DanHerbert/9520689

Doing the above means you should never have to use 'sudo' when installing npm modules
globally with the '-g' flag. The following instructions work for Linux but for Mac OS X
omit the 'sudo'

Also to ensure kerberos and node-gyp install correctly run the following on Linux:

sudo npm install -g node-gyp

Any dependency that you want added to your global path must be installed globally:

sudo npm install -g gulp
sudo npm install -g karma
sudo npm install -g phantomjs-prebuilt

Google Chrome was discontinued for RHEL/CentOS 6.x on up but a work around is here:

Specifications (64 bit) -
IDE: Netbeans 8 (requires Java 8 SDK)
OS: Mac OS X and CentOS (6.5+)
Browser: Google Chrome

NodeJS (NPM) Installation:
Google search "NodeJS Windows" The first hit should be a link to nodejs.org Navigate to that link and download NodeJS. NodeJS contains npm.

Now use Git (install first) to clone the tutorial:

git clone https://github.com/jasonwr/MEANStackJHUEPIndStudies.git

Navigate to the newly cloned project:

cd MEANStackJHUEPIndStudies

Now since NodeJS is installed download the dependencies contained in package.json
All the developer dependencies are also in here.

npm install

Note:
If you see any deprecated modules feel free to adjust the package.json and submit a fork request to the Github repository.0fc.


Mongo Installation:
Download Mongo from www.mongodb.com
If your on a Mac open a terminal and add the path of your Mongo directory with the bin to the /etc/paths file (use vi or emacs to edit this file, must be sudo). Then restart your terminal session and type:

echo $PATH

The path should be of the format <path-to-mongo>/bin Where "<path-to-mongo>" is the location of your mongo download and the bin directory should be under there.
If you're using Linux simply append the Mongo bin to your PATH variable in your .bashrc or .bash_profile file.

Now create the db directory under your home directory:

mkdir -p ~/data/db

Then start up the mongo daemon:

mongod --dbpath ~/data/db

Open up a new terminal tab and type the following for database access:

mongo

Troubleshooting Mongo:
Do not create the db directory under root (/data/db) rather for security and simplicity run under your home directory. If you create under /data/db this requires root (sudo) to run. If you attempt to connect and get a timed out connection examine the mongod output. Chances are you attempted connection before the daemon was finished setting up the socket.
